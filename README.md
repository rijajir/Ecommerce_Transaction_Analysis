## Exploratory Data Analysis

### Seasonality Analysis

#### Sales Performance
![Seasonality Sales Trend](images/seasonality_trend.png)

**Insight**:

Based on the seasonality sales trend, the sales are highest in November and May, with a dip in February. Across four quarters, sales are highest in Q4 and lowest in Q1. The sales appear to fluctuate with a peak around week 17. Sales peak around the 24th and 30th day of the month, but dip drastically on the 29th. Also, the highest sales were on Tuesday and Monday, with a dip on Saturday. The middle of the afternoon and late evening are the peak of sales, with a dip in the early morning.

#### Month-Over-Month Change

##### Sales Rate Change
![Sales Rate](images/sales_change_rate.png)

**Insight**:

Strong Growth Periods:
* March: Sales experienced a significant increase of 30.98% compared to the previous month.
* April: The momentum continued with an even higher growth rate of 37.08%.
* May: Sales further accelerated, reaching a peak with a 38.09% increase.
* July: After a dip in June, sales rebounded with a 26.07% increase.
* November: Sales saw a moderate growth of 18.13%.

Decline Periods:
* February: Sales declined by 12.42% compared to the previous month.
* June: A significant drop of 22.06% occurred.
* August: Sales decreased by 17.99%.
* December: The year ended with a decline of 12.61%.

Average Change in Sales Rate Month-Over-Month: 8.8%

#### Profit Rate Change
![Profit Rate](images/profit_change_rate.png)

**Insight**:

Strong Growth Periods:
* March: Profit significant increase of 31.08% compared to the previous month.
* April: Profit further accelerated, reaching a peak with a 38.18% increase.
* May: The momentum break with a slightly lower growth rate of 36.58%.
* July: After a dip in June, profit rebounded with a 25.48% increase.
* November: Profit saw a moderate growth of 18.87%.

Decline Periods:
* February: Profit declined by 12.19% compared to the previous month.
* June: A significant drop of 21.35% occurred.
* August: Profit decreased again by 18.03%.
* December: The year ended with a decline of 12.78%.

Average Change in Profit Rate Month-Over-Month: 8.9%

## Cohort Analysis

![Customer Cohort](images/cust_cohort.png)

**Insight**:

In the Cohort Table, we had insights that `2.473 customers` made transactions in **January**, but in **February**, only `64 of the same customers` retained and made transactions. However had increased again in May `(154 customers)` and November `(155 customers)`.

![Retention Rate](images/retention_rate.png)

**Insight**:

The **average customer retention rate is `5.54%`**. This means, on average, 5.54% of customers acquired in a specific month are still active in the following months. The rate seems logical to be a low trend because the **average of frequency orders per customer during the year is only 1-2 times**, and the **maximum order is 6 times with only one customer**.

## Pareto Analysis

### Customer VS Sales

![Cust Pareto](images/cust_pareto.png)

**Insight**:

With a half amount of customers 59 % (22.994), it contributes 80 % of Sales. While the rest of 41 % (15.996) seem to have a low contribution. That's a good start, we'll further analyze the customer segment based on purchase behavior later.

### Product VS Profit

![Product Pareto](images/product_pareto.png)

**Insight**:

36 % of products can boost 80 % of profit by year. Then 95 % of profit was boosted by 67 % of products, which means 37 % of products had a poor contribution. Concentrate on the 36 % of top products  because it has a high profit margin and also evaluate the low-performing products when the profit margin is higher than mid-performing, consider not discontinuing them.

## Customer Segmentation

### Build RFM Dataframe

**Define the RFM features as follows:**

* Recency (R): Using Order_Date feature, calculate the number of days since the customer's last purchase.
* Frequency (F): Using Order_Date feature, calculate the number of total order date for each customer. This represents how often the customer has made purchases.
* Monetary (M): Using Sales feature, calculate the total sales for each customer. This represents the total value of the customer's purchases.


| **Customer_Id** | **Recency**    | **Frequency**   | **Monetary**     |
|-----------------|----------------|-----------------|------------------|
| **10000**       | 24             | 2               | 293.00           |
| **10002**       | 132            | 1               | 149.00           |
| **10004**       | 144            | 1               | 85.00            |
| **10006**       | 144            | 2               | 440.00           |
| **10013**       | 227            | 1               | 159.00           |

**Build the K Means clustering model with 3 features according to RFM.**

Why use RFM?
* RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) Analysis is a segmentation technique that uses customer purchase  behavior to group them into segments. And very effective as the purchase behavior can be summarized by using a small number of variables.
* It is also very useful for targeted marketing campaigns and other customer relationship management initiatives.

Why use K-means?
* K-means is an effective clustering algorithm for customer segmentation and RFM analysis due to its simplicity, efficiency, and interpretability.
* A computationally efficient algorithm, suitable for clustering large datasets.
* Can be relied on to determine an appropriate value for 'k' (the number of clusters) using techniques like the elbow method or silhouette analysis.

### Feature Scaling

Ensuring that Recency, Frequency, and Monetary (RFM) features are on a similar scale before applying the K Means algorithm. This will help KMeans create more meaningful and accurate customer segments based on their RFM behavior.

### Find the best K

![Elbow Method](images/elbow_method.png)
![Elbow Score](images/elbow_score_plot.png)
![Silhouette](images/silhouette.png)

Based on the Elbow Method and Silhouette Analysis suggest 5 clusters for better interpretation and more effective customer segmentation.

### Cluster Viz

### Cluster Analysis

![Cluster Analysis](images/cluster_analysis_plot.png)

**Clusters breakdown and their potential customer segments based on percentiles to rank the customers from the RFM metrics to identify behavior patterns:**

| Cluster | Customer | High    | Moderate | Low     |
|---------|----------|---------|----------|---------|
| 0       | 1.679    | `R,F,M` | x        | x       |
| 1       | 8.872    | x       | `R,F`    | `M`     |
| 2       | 12.060   | x       | x        | `R,F,M` |
| 3       | 8.242    | x       | `R,F,M`  | x       |
| 4       | 8.137    | `F,M`   | `R`      | x       |

**Here's a breakdown of the clusters and their potential customer segments based on percentiles to rank the customers based on the RFM metrics to identify strong or weak behavior patterns:**

---
**Cluster 0: High recency, high frequency, high monetary**
  * `Distribution (4.31%):` Minority cluster with 1.679 customers.
  * `Recency (around 20%):` However, these customers have purchased very recently.
  * `Frequency (above 90%):` They purchase very frequently.
  * `Monetary (above 90%):` They spend a significant high amount of money.

Yeay, Cluster 0 represents the best customers, our `Champions Customers`, they are the company's most valuable assets. They purchase frequently, spend a lot of money, and have made purchases very recently.

---

**Cluster 1: Moderate recency, moderate frequency, low monetary**
  * `Distribution (22.75%):` 8.872 customers.
  * `Recency (around 30%):` Customers who had made purchases somewhat recently too.
  * `Frequency (50%)`: Their purchase frequency is moderate.
  * `Monetary (around 20%)`: They spend a small amount of money.

It represents the `Need Attention Customers`.	These customers have purchased recently but have only made one purchase. They need encouragement for repeat purchases and more spending.

---

**Cluster 2: Low recency, low frequency, low monetary**
  * `Distribution (30.93%):` Dominant clusters with 12.060 customers.
  * `Recency (above 80%):` Customers who hadn't made a purchase in a long time.
  * `Frequency (50%):` Their purchase frequency is only 1 transaction.
  * `Monetary (30%):` They only spend a small amount of money when they make a purchase.

Very clearly, it represents the `At-Risk/Lost Customers`. They haven't purchased recently and might be churned. It's the biggest problem for business.

---

**Cluster 3: Moderate recency, moderate frequency, moderate monetary**
  * `Distribution (21.14%):` 8.242 customers.
  * `Recency (around 30%):` Customers who had made purchases relatively recently.
  * `Frequency (around 50%):` They purchase frequently.
  * `Monetary (around 50%):` They spend a slightly good amount of money.

It represents the `Promising Customers`. They have a moderate purchasing history but haven't purchased recently. Treat them well then I promise they will be loyal.

---

**Cluster 4: Moderate recency, high frequency, high monetary**
  * `Distribution (20.87%):` 8.137 customers.
  * `Recency (around 30%):` Customers who had made purchases relatively recently.
  * `Frequency (above 80%):` They purchase very frequently.
  * `Monetary (around 80%):` They spend a significant amount of money.

  This cluster aligns with the `Loyal Customers`, as they have a high purchase frequency and high spending, even though their recent activity is moderate.

## Conclusion

**To summarize, Kestrel E-commerce has identified key areas for improvement, including customer retention, product performance, and targeted marketing strategies.**

* Kestrel E-commerce's sales performance and profit gained have been quite volatile and has a positive trend throughout the year.

* However, they have a problem with a low rate of customer retention. The average of frequency orders per customer during the year is only 1-2 times. Itâ€™ll be validated by the dominance of At-Risk/Lost Customers in segmentation.

* 59% of customers contribute 80% of sales where they have high to moderate spending purchases throughout the year and it could be the High-Value customers. And only 36% of products perform well, boosting 80% of profit by year, meanwhile, low-performing products like Mouse, Watch, and Keyboard need evaluation to sell better.

* There are 5 Clusters of Customers based on RFM/Spending Profile
  1. At-Risk/Lost Customers 30.93%
  2. Need Attention Customers 22.75%
  3. Promising Customers 21.14%
  4. Loyal Customers 20.87%
